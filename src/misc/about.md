# About MeshNodes

This project was made and is maintained by Laszlo Timar in 2025.

The main inspiration was to combine Unity's Mesh API with the power of proper node-based procedural mesh generation, like in Blender's geometry nodes.
The two are very different, and Blender's geometry nodes was not meant to be used in realtime engines, however, can produce stunning results.
The idea was to create something similar, which is not a copy of geometry nodes, but an alternative approach to procedural mesh generation, which is more compatible with Unity's Mesh API.

This project is not finished, and it never will be. New nodes are fun to create and implement, so the nodes will be added as they are needed, with a neverending journey, to fulfill my hunger for procedural 3D mesh generation.

However my time is pretty limited, I will make a page for requesting new nodes, but at this time there is none.
