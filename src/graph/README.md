## What is MeshNodes?

**MeshNodes** is a Unity asset designed to create and manipulate 3D meshes procedurally. It allows developers to generate meshes both in the Unity Editor and, more importantly, at runtime. The primary goal of MeshNodes is to provide a robust toolset for developers aiming to create procedural 3D environments and objects.

Currently, this toolset is exclusive to Unity and is not compatible with other game engines. However, its code architecture has been designed in a data-driven manner, making future portability feasible, even though the current focus remains within the scope of this project.
