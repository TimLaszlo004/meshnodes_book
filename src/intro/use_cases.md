# Use cases

## Advanced building mechanics
If your game has a building system, like cars, cities or factories you can easily generate objects procedurally with this asset. This way you can add variety to your game which can enable you to create more advanced systems (for example, if you make a tire-generation-graph, you can create any tires for your cars, with simple parameters or even leave it to the player to customize the tires to their needs).

## Procedural level generation
You need a forest or a deserted land? Trees and rocks can be generated with MeshNodes, so you never run out of models to use. If you leverage the runtime generation, you can also create infinite levels (however, keep in mind, that massive generations may impact performance and may require you to adjust your logic and load assets accordingly).

## Fast prototyping tools
Buildings, trees, walls, fences, roads, bridges and crowds - they are all objects usually made by artists or designers. When prototyping, we can easily use default cubes, spheres or some low-poly models, which will be replaced later with more detailed assets.

But with MeshNodes you can build a graph for these to generate them procedurally, and this makes the prototyping more accurate and visually appealing. That is useful for good looking devlogs even in the early stages of development.
